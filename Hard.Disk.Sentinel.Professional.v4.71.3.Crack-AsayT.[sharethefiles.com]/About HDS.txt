Hard Disk Sentinel

Hard Disk Sentinel (HDSentinel) is a multi-OS SSD and HDD monitoring and analysis software. Its goal
is to find, test, diagnose and repair hard disk drive problems, report and display SSD and HDD health,
performance degradations and failures. Hard Disk Sentinel gives complete textual description, tips and
displays/reports the most comprehensive information about the hard disks and solid state disks inside
the computer and in external enclosures (USB hard disks / e-SATA hard disks). Many different alerts
and report options are available to ensure maximum safety of your valuable data.

No need to use separate tools to verify internal hard disks, external hard disks, SSDs, hybrid disk
drives (SSHD), disks in RAID arrays as these are all included in a single software.

Hard Disk Sentinel monitors hard disk drive / HDD status including health, temperature and all
S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) values for all hard disks. Also it
measures the disk transfer speed in real time which can be used as a benchmark or to detect possible
hard disk failures, performance degradations.

HDSentinel is the perfect data protection solution: it can be effectively used to prevent HDD failure
and SSD / HDD data loss because it has the most sensitive disk health rating system which is extremely
sensitive to disk problems. This way even a small HDD problem can't be missed. The Professional version
has scheduled and automatic (on-problem) disk backup options to prevent data loss caused by not only
failure but by malware or accidental delete also.
